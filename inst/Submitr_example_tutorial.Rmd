```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```


## Please login to submission system 

```{r __login__}
# Local memory
 credentials <-  tibble::tribble(
  ~ id,  ~ password,
  "Anne", "dog",
  "Betty", "cat"
)
storage_actions <- in_local_file("submissions.csv")

# What things look like if using Google Sheets
# credentials <- 
#   "1h_G3M-HTVfrC8lqHS8aKn_jVFg2_Rnnbtk5erpWX54o"
# storage_actions <- in_google_sheets(
#   "1D9kzkgUEGRvv2Q7q2n8ca9gcZk1_aglodbGJ3rLCYjI")


authorize_submissions(
  credentials,
  recorder = storage_actions$write
  )
```

If you don't see "ID validated" in a green box, your work is not being recorded.

Get the file with the submissions:

```{r echo=FALSE}
secret_word <- "hello" # the secret to download the submissions
```

```{r child = system.file("download_link.Rmd", package = "submitr")}
```


## Topic One

```{r planets}
question("Which planet do we live on?",
         answer("Mars", correct=FALSE),
         answer("Earth", correct = TRUE,  message = "Good job Earthling!"),
         answer("Saturn",  correct = FALSE),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE
        )
```




## Topic Two

```{r some_code, exercise=TRUE}
head(mtcars, 2)
```

```{r some_code-hint-1}
"What do you think?"
```

```{r some_code-hint-2}
"Go with your gut"
```

## Video

If I make this into an embedded video (by prepending the link with "bang!") the event recorder doesn't always work.
